        # The Relatedness of individuals is obtained using the ukbgene utility (Resource 664) which generates a plaintext file with 5 space-separated columns:
                #       ID for participant 1 in related pair;
                #       ID for participant 2 in related pair;
                #       HetHet : fraction of markers for which the pair both have a heterozygous genotype;
                #       IBS0 : fraction of markers for which the pair shares zero alleles;
                #       Kinship: Estimate of the kinship coefficient for this pair based on the set of markers used in the kinship inference;

                #       where the HetHet, IBS0 and Kinship values were generated by the KING software.
